A fun little app trying to figure out the 'Game of Life' and testing using Jest

* clone the repo to your computer
* run 'npm install' in the top directory
* to start the app run 'gulp' to compile files and be ready to show on localhost
* or run 'gulp watch' to automatically open the client on localhost
* click on some cells to see the magic happen

* to run the Jest tests run 'npm run test' on the top level directory to see the results
